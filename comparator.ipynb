      "The administration of TAKHZYRO can be summarised in 5 steps:\n",
      "1. Prepare the vial of TAKHZYRO\n",
      "2. Attach blunt tip vial access needle to syringe\n",
      "3. Transfer TAKHZYRO into syringe and switch to the pointed tip administration (injection) needle\n",
      "4. Select and prepare injection site\n",
      "5. Inject TAKHZYRO\n",
      "Step 1: Prepare the vial of TAKHZYRO\n",
      "a. Take the vial out of the refrigerator 15 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection.\n",
      "b. Clean your work area and wash your hands prior to preparing your dose. Do not touch any surface or body part, especially your face, after washing your hands before injection.\n",
      "c. Gather your TAKHZYRO and supplies and place them on your well-ligthed work surface.\n",
      "d. Remove the vial from the packaging.\n",
      "e. Gently invert the vial 3 to 5 times to ensure the solution is mixed. Do not shake to avoid foaming.\n",
      "f. Look at the solution in the vial for visible particles or a change in the colour (normally colourless to slightly yellow). Do not use if you see particles or a change in colour.\n",
      "Important: Do not shake the vial.\n",
      "g. Remove the plastic cap from the drug vial. Do not remove the drug vial rubber stopper.\n",
      "h. Place the vial on a flat surface. Clean the drug vial rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe and allow it to dry.\n",
      "Step 2: Attach blunt tip vial access needle to syringe\n",
      "a. Screw the 18G blunt tip vial access needle to the 3 ml syringe.\n",
      "Important: Do not remove the needle cap from the needle when attaching to the syringe.\n",
      "b. Pull back the plunger to fill the syringe with air equal to the amount of drug in the vial.\n",
      "c. Pull off the needle cap straight away from the syringe without touching the needle. Do not pull on the plunger.\n",
      "Step 3: Transfer TAKHZYRO into syringe and switch to the pointed tip administration (injection) needle\n",
      "a. Insert the needle into the center of the rubber stopper.\n",
      "b. Push the plunger down to inject air into the vial and hold the plunger down.\n",
      "c. Slowly turn the vial upside down with needle and syringe attached. Pull back on the plunger to withdraw the full dose in the vial.\n",
      "Important: Be sure to keep the tip of the needle in the liquid to avoid drawing air in as you pull back the plunger.\n",
      "d. Remove large air bubbles by gently tapping on the syringe with your fingers until the bubbles rise to the top of the syringe.\n",
      "e. Slowly push the plunger, allowing air to go back into the vial, until the drug reaches the top of the syringe.\n",
      "f. Repeat these steps until large air bubbles are removed.\n",
      "g. Without removing the needle from the vial, unscrew the syringe by holding the needle hub and turning the syringe counter clockwise. Be careful not to press down on\n",
      "the plunger, as the drug will be pushed out.\n",
      "h. Return the syringe to an upright position.\n",
      "i. Discard the vial with the 18G needle still inside into a sharps container\n",
      "j. Screw the 27G ½-inch administration (injection) needle to the syringe.\n",
      "Important: Do not remove the needle cap from the needle when attaching to the syringe.\n",
      "Do not use the blunt tip vial access needle to inject Takhzyro as this may cause harm such as pain and bleeding.\n",
      "Step 4: Select and prepare injection site\n",
      "a. Choose an injection site on your stomach (abdomen), thigh, or upper arm.\n",
      "b. Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe and allow it to dry completely.\n",
      "Important:\n",
      "• Rotate injection sites to keep skin healthy.\n",
      "• The area you choose for injection should be at least 2 inches (5 cm) away from any scars or your belly button (navel). Do not choose an area that is bruised, swollen, or painful.\n",
      "• The outer area of the upper arm is not recommended for self-administration.\n",
      "• TAKHZYRO must be administered within 2 hours of preparing your dosing syringe at room temperature. After the dosing syringe is prepared, it can be refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) and must be used within 8 hours of preparation. Take the prepared syringe out of the fridge 15 minutes before use to allow it to reach room temperature before injecting.\n",
      "Step 5: Inject TAKHZYRO\n",
      "a. Pull off the needle cap straight away from the syringe without touching the needle. Do not pull on the plunger. Do not touch the needle tip or allow it to touch any other surface.\n",
      "b. Gently pinch 1 inch/2.5 cm of skin at your cleaned injection site and insert the needle.\n",
      "Important: Be sure to inject into a subcutaneous space that is not too shallow (skin layer) or too deep (muscle).\n",
      "c. Push the plunger slowly until no contents remain in the syringe. Release the skin fold and gently remove the needle. Do not recap the needle.\n",
      "d. Place the 27G ½-inch administration (injection) needle and the syringe in a sharps container.\n"
